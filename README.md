## Backend

Node.js runs Express to handle GET requests to various paths. These GET requests point to HTML files with a "[name]Bundle.js" created by Webpack handling all the React code. 

Webpack: Bundles CSS and JS from the individual files into one js.

Babel: Converts ES6 code written for React into ES5 for most browsers.

## Frontend

React: Each different JS file corresponding to the HTML has its own components.
